**explanation**: ```less -N``` numbers each line in the file. For example, there will be a 1 next to the first line in the file, 2 next to the second line in the file, and so on. This is useful because it allows you to find a specific line quickly without having to skim through the whole file. An example of this could be if Person A and Person B are having a discussion about one of the .txt files and Person A wants Person B to look at line 159 of the file. Person A could then tell Person B to use ```less -N``` and Command+F "159" to easily find what line 159 says. 
  
**citation**: I found this command-line option by using the built in command ```man less```.
